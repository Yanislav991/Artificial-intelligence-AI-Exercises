    "We know that for an n-dimensional vector space, we need **exactly n** vectors to form a basis. Let's visualize that.\n",
    "\n",
    "The function you wrote last time for visualizing complex numbers can be extended to visualize any set of vectors. If you haven't already written that, have a look at [this StackOverflow post](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/12265234/how-to-plot-2d-math-vectors-with-matplotlib). You need to use the `quiver()` function which accepts the $x$ and $y$ coordinates of the start and end points.\n",
    "\n",
    "Write a function which accepts an array of vectors in the format `[start_x, start_y, end_x, end_y]` and plots them. Optionally, you can add different colors. When you call `quiver()` pass `color = colors` as the last parameter and it will take care of them.\n",
    "\n",
    "Make sure to leave enough space on the axes. `quiver()` doesn't resize the plot area automatically to fit everything. You can do this manually. A simple `plt.xlim(-10, 10)` and `plt.ylim(-10, 10)` will do the job but you can do much better if you wish :)."

    "### Problem 2. Vectorization in `numpy`\n",
    "As programmers, we're used to writing for-loops to iterate over collections. This is quite OK but in Python makes the code slow (because it's an interpreted, dynamically-typed language). For example, a \"standard\" way of summing an array would be\n",
    "```python\n",
    "x = [2, 3, 8, -2.3, 0, 15]\n",
    "sum = 0\n",
    "for i in range(len(x)):\n",
    "    sum += x[i]\n",
    "print(sum)\n",

    "1. Operations in C are very, very, VERY fast\n",
    "2. Communication between C and Python is slow\n",
    "\n",
    "This means we should prepare our code to use `numpy` arrays as much as possible. First of all, this gives us a great computational advantage: the code is very fast. Second, it will look simpler and more beautiful. Compare the previous code with this one:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "x = [2, 3, 8, -2.3, 0, 15]\n",
    "numpy_sum = np.sum(x)\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Of course, the for-loop is still done, it's just hidden.\n",
    "\n",
    "The basic rule is **whenever possible, avoid looping and use vectors and matrices**. Sometimes it's impossible to avoid loops and that's OK.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's create a performance test. Create a large array of random numbers. You can use `np.random.random()`. Sum the array using `numpy` and using the for-loop. Compare the times. In some cases, the performance difference will be several hundred times (e.g. length = $1.10^7$, difference $\\approx 2000$ times: $\\approx 0.01ms$ for the `sum()` and $\\approx 2s$ for the loop).\n",
    "\n",
    "Don't forget to see that the sums are equal. A fast but incorrect algorihm is not an option :).\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, call the function for different lengths and create two plots showing the time it takes to multiply different-length arrays. **Idea:** You can plot them on two separate y-axes on the same plot. Look at the `twiny()` function. See how much time it takes to perform both operations.\n",
